They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep
his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that
the old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish
constantly to make sure it was true.
It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the
dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so
fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was
in the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming
on the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it,
and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Mako shark built to swim
as fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his
jaws. His back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was
smooth and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which
were tight shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin
knifing through the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of
his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramidshaped teeth of most sharks. They were shaped like a man’s fingers when they are
crisped like claws. They were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had
razor-sharp cutting edges on both sides. This was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in
the sea, that were so fast and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy. Now
he speeded up as he smelled the fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water
